# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub, it can be last or grow to be something new.

I have over 15 years experience in VFX and animation
industry and 5 years overlapped in game design and
development. I participate in the creation of game
conception with the content team, create concise design
documentation of game vision and build game & system
mechanics that are fundamentally fun. I have skills in
critical problem solving and creative thinking.
